# GLOBAL-ONLINE-ORDERS

This is an E-commerce dataset that is gotten from Kaggle. It is a hypothetical data, they are not real data as it was generated for a particular set of purposes.
The dataset is a csv file and it was imported into SQL SERVER DATABASE for analysis. 
I connected python to the SQL Server Database. I created visualizations using python and some further analysis.
